# Machine Learning
### Create Machine Learning Model to Predict MNIST Dataset.
- The MNIST dataset Train 60000 Test 10000 : 10 Classes
- Model Support Vector Machine
- Model Naive Bayes
- Model Random Forest
- Model K-Nearest Neighbor
- Hyperparameter Tunning with GridSearch
- Comparing Model K-Nearest Neighbor > Random Forest > Support Vector Machine > Naive Bayes
